# PPT Master Skill

> AI-driven multi-format SVG content generation system. Converts source documents into high-quality SVG pages through multi-role collaboration and exports to PPTX.

**Core Pipeline**: `Source Intake → Visual Style + Analysis Decision → Analysis Generation → Content Inventory + Page Outline → Outline Confirmation → Executor → Export`

### SVG Page-Design Boundary

| Scope | Contract |
|---|---|
| Any route that authors or regenerates slide visuals through SVG | `svg_output/` is the complete page-design source: every visible text, image, shape, chart/table fallback, and layout element that should appear on the exported slide is present in that page SVG or referenced by it. |
| Templates, `design_spec.md`, and `spec_lock.md` | Authoring/control inputs. They guide SVG creation but MUST NOT supply visible slide content that is absent from the completed SVG during export. |
| Semantic SVG markers | Minimal rendering-neutral compiler hints used only after existing Layout/Layer/Placeholder/Native metadata has been considered. They never replace native SVG geometry, text, styles, grouping, or asset references. |
| `svg_final/` | Mandatory derived, self-contained SVG visual preview. It may be opened directly or inserted into PowerPoint as an SVG picture, but it is not a supported PPTX source and carries no manual Convert-to-Shape compatibility contract. |
| SVG-to-PPTX export | The only supported generated-PPTX route reads `svg_output/` and maps its content through the project converter to DrawingML/native objects. It may reorganize represented content into Master/Layout/Slide structure but MUST NOT invent new visible page content. |
| Direct PPTX and presentation-behavior workflows | Remain separate. `template-fill-pptx`, `native-enhance-pptx`, animations, transitions, speaker notes, narration, and package relationships are not required to round-trip through SVG. |

**MUST — page-design closure**: For an SVG-authoring route, inspect the final page SVG to determine what the exported slide looks like. Do not reinterpret “SVG is the page-design language” as “SVG is the complete PPTX package description language.”

> [!CAUTION]
> ## 🚨 Global Execution Discipline (MANDATORY)
>
> **This workflow is a strict serial pipeline. The following rules have the highest priority — violating any one of them constitutes execution failure:**
>
> 1. **SERIAL EXECUTION** — Steps MUST be executed in order; the output of each step is the input for the next. Non-BLOCKING adjacent steps may proceed continuously once prerequisites are met, without waiting for the user to say "continue"
> 2. **BLOCKING = HARD STOP** — Steps marked ⛔ BLOCKING require a full stop; the AI MUST wait for an explicit user response before proceeding and MUST NOT make any decisions on behalf of the user
> 3. **NO CROSS-PHASE BUNDLING** — Cross-phase bundling is FORBIDDEN. New/restructured decks have two ⛔ BLOCKING decisions: the explicit style + professional-analysis decision, then the final page-outline confirmation. Page count MUST NOT be locked before the analysis decision is resolved and all requested analysis images exist.
> 4. **GATE BEFORE ENTRY** — Each Step has prerequisites (🚧 GATE) listed at the top; these MUST be verified before starting that Step
> 5. **NO SPECULATIVE EXECUTION** — "Pre-preparing" content for subsequent Steps is FORBIDDEN (e.g., writing SVG code during the Strategist phase)
> 6. **NO SUB-AGENT SVG GENERATION** — Executor Step 6 SVG generation is context-dependent and MUST be completed by the current main agent end-to-end. Delegating page SVG generation to sub-agents is FORBIDDEN
> 7. **SEQUENTIAL PAGE GENERATION ONLY** — In Executor Step 6, after the global design context is confirmed, SVG pages MUST be generated sequentially page by page in one continuous pass. Grouped page batches (for example, 5 pages at a time) are FORBIDDEN
> 8. **SPEC_LOCK RE-READ PER PAGE** — Before generating each SVG page, Executor MUST `read_file <project_path>/spec_lock.md`. All colors / fonts / icons / images MUST come from this file — no values from memory or invented on the fly. Executor MUST also read `pptx_structure.mode`, the current page's `page_rhythm` (`anchor` / `dense` / `breathing`), and `page_charts`. Only a deck/layout template route (`mode: structured`) looks up `page_layouts` (the input template SVG), `page_pptx_layouts` (the page assignment), `pptx_masters`, `pptx_layouts` (the unique reusable roster), and `template_adherence`; free-design and brand-only routes use `mode: flat` and omit those sections. This rule exists to resist context-compression drift on long decks and to break the uniform "every page is a card grid" default
> 9. **SVG MUST BE HAND-WRITTEN, NOT SCRIPT-GENERATED** — Every SVG page is written by the main agent directly, one page at a time (see rules 6 and 7). Writing or running a Python / Node / shell script that produces the SVG files in batch — looping over pages, templating from data, or emitting them via a generator — is FORBIDDEN, including under "save tokens", "quick draft", or "user is in a hurry" pretexts. The script-generation path was tried on a feature branch and abandoned: cross-page visual consistency depends on per-page authoring with full upstream context, which a generator script cannot reproduce. **Narrow exception**: `preset_shape_svg.py` may print one deterministic stock-shape fragment to stdout after the main agent has selected its semantic role, frame, and paint. It cannot write `svg_output/`, choose layout, batch shapes, or generate a page; the main agent reads the fragment and inserts it through the normal hand-authored page edit
> 10. **FOLLOW DETERMINISTIC ROUTING RULES** — Do not add blocking routing questions when this skill defines a route. If the user request violates a route precondition, state the required prerequisite and stop that route instead of asking the user to choose around the rule. Ordinary finite options, stylistic preferences, and recoverable details are surfaced with a recommended value plus alternatives at the next existing confirmation gate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## 🌐 Language & Communication Rule
>
> - **Response language**: match the user's input and source materials. Explicit user override (e.g., "请用英文回答") takes precedence.
> - **User-facing option labels**: when presenting confirmations, brief proposals, choices, or finite option sets, use the user's language for labels and explanations. English enum IDs / file fields may appear in parentheses for precision, but never rely on English-only labels such as `deck`, `layout`, `mirror`, or `fidelity` without a localized explanation.
> - **Template format**: `design_spec.md` MUST follow its original English template structure (section headings, field names) regardless of conversation language. Content values may be in the user's language.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## 🔌 Compatibility With Generic Coding Skills
>
> - `ppt-master` is a repository-specific workflow, not a general application scaffold
> - Do NOT create `.worktrees/`, `tests/`, branch workflows, or generic engineering structure by default
> - On conflict with a generic coding skill, follow this skill unless the user explicitly says otherwise

| `OPTIONAL` | Run only when explicitly triggered or when the route says so |
| `FALLBACK` | Recovery path after the primary path fails |
| `GATE` | Required checkpoint before entering the next step |

## Standalone Workflows

**Route authority**: Use [`workflows/routing.md`](workflows/routing.md) before entering the main pipeline or any standalone workflow.

**Registry**: Use [`workflows/index.md`](workflows/index.md) for the complete workflow list, triggers, preconditions, exclusions, outputs, and blocking points.

### AIRI v2 Visual Route

For every new or restructured deck, run [`airi-workflow-wizard`](workflows/airi-workflow-wizard.md) as the planning gate. It owns the reusable style contact sheets, the explicit professional-analysis Yes/No decision, post-analysis content inventory, and page-by-page outline confirmation.

**Default surface — chat contact sheets.** Show these reusable assets directly in chat and ask the user to reply with numbers / ids:

- `assets/contact-sheets/ppt_visual_styles.png` (SVG fallback: `.svg`)
- `assets/contact-sheets/analysis_visual_styles.png` (SVG fallback: `.svg`)
- `assets/contact-sheets/analysis_domains.md` for the four user-facing domains: architecture / interior / landscape / planning

After a visual style, analysis style, preview, or analysis domain is added or changed, rebuild all three artifacts once:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/build_contact_sheets.py
```

Do not start the browser planning server by default. `confirm_ui/server.py --wizard` remains an explicit opt-in compatibility surface only when the user asks for an interactive browser editor. The two blocking decisions and their order remain unchanged; never return to early page-count confirmation.

### PPTX Route Boundary

| User intent | Route |
|---|---|
| Raw PPTX template plus new material/topic, generate a PPTX | [`template-fill-pptx`](workflows/template-fill-pptx.md) |
| Existing PPTX, preserve page count/order and slide wording 1:1, improve layout | [`beautify-pptx`](workflows/beautify-pptx.md) |
| Existing PPTX as source material, rethink outline or change page count/order | Main pipeline via `source_to_md.py` plus PPTX intake |
| Build a reusable template package from a PPTX/design reference | [`create-template`](workflows/create-template.md), then return with the generated template workspace path |
| Finished PPTX, keep content/layout stable and add notes/audio/timing/transitions | [`native-enhance-pptx`](workflows/native-enhance-pptx.md) |

**MUST**: Raw `.pptx` template plus "generate PPTX" routes to `template-fill-pptx` by default. The SVG generation route consumes only an explicit template workspace path with a valid `templates/design_spec.md`, or a supported direct/legacy package root with `design_spec.md`.

**MUST**: Beautify is strictly 1:1. Any split, merge, drop, reorder, or page-count change routes to the main pipeline.

**MUST — reusable template mode boundary**: `create-template` has two distinct
contracts. `standard` and `fidelity` author new SVG prototypes and their own
Master/Layout/slot system; source visuals and assets are references, and source
Master/Layout topology is neither preserved nor distilled. `mirror` is a
restoration path: preserve the source slide roster/order, visual appearance,
Master/Layout parentage and identities, placeholder type/index/bounds, native
object ownership, and supported native-shape metadata. The lossless import is
the restoration authority; the lightweight authoring projection exists only to
keep model context small. Mechanical normalization may express the source facts
in the current explicit SVG contract and expand fixed-layer group wrappers into
direct atoms, but it MUST NOT merge, split, promote, demote, rename, or
re-parent source structure. Export compiles the selected contract and never
infers a different one. Mirror emits one complete page prototype per source
Slide plus one definition-only `layout_<layout_key>.svg` prototype for every
source Layout unused by those Slides. The independent Master/Layout roster then
registers the complete supported source graph without publishing synthetic
carrier pages. Stop only when required native evidence is missing or unsupported;
never silently drop or merge an identity.

**FALLBACK**: Ambiguous requests such as "make this PPT more professional" require exactly one discriminator question: preserve original page count/order and slide wording, or treat the deck as source material and restructure it?

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Source Content Processing

🚧 **GATE**: User has provided source material (PDF / DOCX / EPUB / URL / Markdown file / text description / conversation content — any form is acceptable).

> **No source content?** When the user supplies only a topic name or requirements without any file or substantive description, run the [`topic-research`](workflows/topic-research.md) workflow first, then return here with its products as input.

When the user provides non-Markdown content, convert immediately through the
unified dispatcher. It preserves the backend converters' existing behavior,
routes by source type, and writes the standard Markdown plus conversion profile.

| User Provides | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| PDF / DOCX / Office document / XLSX / XLSM / PPTX / EPUB / HTML / LaTeX / RST / web URL | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md.py <file_or_URL_or_dir> [<file_or_URL_or_dir> ...]` |
| CSV / TSV | Read directly as plain-text table source |
| Markdown | Read directly |

For PPTX sources, Step 1 converts the deck to Markdown content; after Step 2
`import-sources`, standard PPTX intake is also written to `<project>/analysis/`.
Use `source_to_md.py -t <type>` only when extension detection is ambiguous.
Default local conversion writes Markdown/profile outputs beside each source file.
Use `-o` only when a specific output file/directory is required; with multiple
inputs or directory inputs, `-o` is an output directory. Backend converter details are documented in
[`scripts/docs/conversion.md`](scripts/docs/conversion.md).

> **Office vector assets (EMF/WMF) from DOCX/PPTX sources**:
> Source conversion extracts embedded Office vector images (.emf/.wmf)
> alongside bitmap images when the source format exposes them. After `import-sources`, these land in `images/`
> together with `image_manifest.json` and are first-class assets in §VIII Image Resource List.
>
> **Do NOT convert EMF/WMF to PNG.** The PPT Master pipeline preserves them as external
> references (`finalize_svg.py` skips them) and `svg_to_pptx.py` embeds them as
> PPTX-native media via `image/x-emf` / `image/x-wmf` MIME — PowerPoint renders them at full vector fidelity.
> Converting via LibreOffice/Inkscape introduces CJK font substitution drift and
> rasterization loss; the original EMF/WMF is always higher fidelity than the converted PNG.
>
> Browser-based live preview cannot render EMF (will show blank) — this is expected;
> the PPTX output is the source of truth.

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm source content is ready, proceed to Step 2.**

---

### Step 2: Project Initialization

🚧 **GATE**: Step 1 complete; source content is ready (Markdown file, user-provided text, or requirements described in conversation are all valid).

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py init <project_name> --format <format>
```

Format options must be named with concrete dimensions. Default: `ppt169` = `1280x720`, `viewBox="0 0 1280 720"`. Other examples: `ppt43` = `1024x768`, `story` = `1080x1920`, `banner` = `1920x1080`. For the full format list, see `references/canvas-formats.md`.

Import source content (choose based on the situation):

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Has source files (PDF/MD/etc.) | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py import-sources <project_path> <source_files_or_dirs...> --move` |
| User provided text directly in conversation | No import needed — content is already in conversation context; subsequent steps can reference it directly |

For PPTX sources, `import-sources` automatically runs the standard intake enrichment:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/pptx_intake.py <project_path>/sources/<source.pptx> -o <project_path>/analysis
```

For each PPTX it writes `<stem>.identity.json` (canvas, theme palette/fonts, observed usage) and `<stem>.slide_library.json` (text slots, geometry, native tables, native chart caches, SmartArt nodes/connections), and merges that deck's Strategist-facing digest into the single multi-deck index `analysis/source_profile.json` (`decks[]`, one self-contained entry per source deck, with prefixed artifact pointers). In the main generation path these are source facts and recommendation candidates, not replica constraints; beautify and template-fill workflows decide separately which fields become locked constraints.

Multi-deck: several PPTX files may be imported into one main-pipeline project — each gets its own `<stem>.*` artifacts and a deck entry in `source_profile.json`. `source_profile.json` stays the single must-read index (one entry for a one-deck project, several for a combined-source project). Stems must be distinct; re-importing the same stem replaces that deck's entry. The beautify / template-fill workflows remain single-deck (1:1 to one chosen source deck) and read that deck's `<stem>.*` artifacts.

> ⚠️ **MUST use `--move`** (not copy): all source files — Step 1's generated Markdown, original PDFs / MDs / images — go into `sources/` via `import-sources --move`. If Step 1 wrote Markdown beside the original sources, pass that source path/directory once. If Step 1 used `-o` to write Markdown elsewhere, pass both the original source path(s)/directory and the Markdown output path(s)/directory. After execution they no longer exist at the original location. Intermediate artifacts (e.g., `_files/`) are handled automatically.

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm project structure created successfully, `sources/` contains all source files, converted materials are ready. Proceed to Step 3.**

---

### Step 3: Template Option

🚧 **GATE**: Step 2 complete; project directory structure is ready.

**Default — free design.** Proceed directly to Step 4. Do NOT query any `*_index.json` unless triggered. Do NOT ask the user. Do NOT proactively suggest, hint at, or fuzzy-match any template based on content, slug-like words, or vague style descriptions.

**Hard boundary — raw PPTX template references are not Step 3 templates.** PPTX-as-source remains valid in Step 1 / Step 2, and raw PPTX template + generated PPTX routes to `template-fill`. But if the user wants the SVG/template-based generation route from that PPTX, stop before Step 3. The user must first run [`workflows/create-template.md`](workflows/create-template.md), then return with the generated template workspace path. Step 3 consumes an explicit workspace whose `templates/design_spec.md` declares `kind: brand` / `kind: layout` / `kind: deck`, or a compatible legacy-flat package whose root `design_spec.md` declares one of those kinds.

Do **not** reinterpret this boundary as 1:1 redesign or free SVG generation. Use `template-fill` for raw PPTX template + generated PPTX requests; use `beautify` only when the source deck's page count, order, and wording are preserved.

**Template flow triggers ONLY on explicit directory paths** supplied by the user in their initial message, plus one narrow workflow handoff: a project-scoped `create-template` run in the current conversation may pass its exact validated project workspace root directly into this Step. The trigger rule is mechanical, not interpretive:

| User input contains | Step 3 action |
|---|---|
| One or more explicit template workspace paths (each resolves to `templates/design_spec.md`, or to a compatible legacy-flat root `design_spec.md`, with `kind: brand` / `kind: layout` / `kind: deck` in YAML frontmatter) | Normalize each source directory, read its `kind`, dispatch per the kind matrix below, fuse if multiple |
| Current `create-template` workflow just completed project scope and validated its exact `<project>/` workspace | Consume that single workspace in place; it cannot join multi-path fusion |
| Anything else — bare template names ("用 presentation_core"), style descriptions ("麦肯锡风格"), brand mentions ("中国电信风格"), vague intent ("想用个模板"), or silence | Skip Step 3, free design |

There is no slug matching, no name lookup, no fuzzy resolution. A name without a path does not trigger — the user must give a path the AI can `cd` into.

**Structured-template preflight (before copy)**: For every deck/layout workspace, inspect all SVG roots and slots under its normalized template source. Every page must declare root Master/Layout key and picker names; Master/Layout visuals must be direct atoms rather than `<g>`; every slot must be a top-level `<g>` with positive bounds and exactly one compatible carrier, or an explicit composite `object` proxy. A zero-slot Layout is valid. If the SVG package uses a legacy semantic contract, run [`restore-pptx-structure`](workflows/restore-pptx-structure.md) first and return to Step 3 with the migrated workspace. A legacy flat directory shape alone is read compatibility and does not trigger restoration.

> Style descriptions ("麦肯锡风格" / "Keynote 风" / "极简风" / etc.) never trigger Step 3. They flow into the Strategist confirmation stage as a style brief (color / typography / tone in fields e–g).

> Bare names ("presentation_core", "中国电信", "anthropic") do NOT trigger Step 3 even if a matching directory exists in the library. The user must give a path. AI must not "helpfully" resolve a name to a path.

> "What templates exist?" is out-of-band Q&A — answer by listing entries from `brands_index.json` / `layouts_index.json` / `decks_index.json` together with their paths. Listing alone does not advance the pipeline; the user must send a path back to trigger Step 3.

> To create a new layout or deck, read [`workflows/create-template.md`](workflows/create-template.md). To create a new brand, read [`workflows/create-brand.md`](workflows/create-brand.md).

#### Three template kinds

The architecture has three independent reference bundles. Full schema in [`docs/zh/templates-architecture.md`](../../docs/zh/templates-architecture.md). Summary:

| Kind | Physical dir | Contains | Frontmatter |
|---|---|---|---|
| **brand** | `templates/brands/<id>/templates/` inside a complete workspace | identity-only segment: color / typography / logo / voice / icon style | `kind: brand` |
| **layout** | `templates/layouts/<id>/templates/` inside a complete workspace | structure-only segment: canvas / page structure / page types / SVG roster | `kind: layout` |
| **deck** | `templates/decks/<id>/templates/` inside a complete workspace | full identity + structure reference with the middle (template overview) segment | `kind: deck` |

**Segment ownership** (governs fusion override priority):

| Segment | Sections | Owner kind on fusion |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | Color Scheme / Typography / Logo / Voice & Tone / Icon Style | brand |
| Structure | Canvas / Page Structure / Page Types / SVG Roster | layout |
| Middle | Template Overview (use cases / design intent) | deck (no other kind writes this) |

#### Single-path dispatch

| User path's `kind` | Step 3 action |
|---|---|
| `kind: brand` | Install `templates/` plus any existing `images/` and `icons/` into the matching project roots; ignore `exports/`. Strategist locks identity; structure stays free. |
| `kind: layout` | Install `templates/` plus any existing `images/` and `icons/` into the matching project roots; ignore `exports/`. Strategist locks structure; identity is decided in confirmation fields e–g. |
| `kind: deck` | Install `templates/` plus any existing `images/` and `icons/` into the matching project roots; ignore `exports/`. Strategist locks all segments; planning narrows to audience / tone before analysis, then derives page count from the post-analysis content inventory. |

Normalize every explicit path before any write:

| Input shape | Spec / SVG source | Asset source | Install rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current workspace: `<root>/templates/design_spec.md` | `<root>/templates/` | Any existing `<root>/images/`, `<root>/icons/` | Map the existing portable roots to the target project's matching roots; ignore `<root>/exports/` |
| Compatible legacy-flat package: `<root>/design_spec.md` | `<root>/` | Package-local files | SVG/spec/non-bitmaps → project `templates/`; bitmaps → project `images/`; route declared icons to project `icons/` |

**Atomic install preflight (mandatory)**: Resolve source and destination paths, enumerate the complete file mapping, and reject every destination collision before copying any file. Equality between a current project workspace root and the target project root means in-place consumption and no copy. For an external single path, a collision stops Step 3 rather than overwriting. For multi-path fusion, do not copy packages sequentially: resolve segment conflicts and asset-name conflicts first, construct one final mapping, then write it once. Never use recursive copy as an implicit conflict policy.

Never infer that a flat directory has legacy Master/Layout semantics solely from packaging.

The same current-workspace routing applies to all three kinds: source/spec in `templates/`, visual assets in `images/`, runtime icons in `icons/`, and on-demand review artifacts in `exports/`. Empty optional roots are omitted rather than retained with placeholder files, so a normal workspace has no `exports/` until a review file is explicitly generated. The spec's `kind` tells Strategist how to read the installed source. Template SVGs are not export-time overlays: visible output still lives completely in `svg_output/`. Their complete visuals and explicit Master/Layout/placeholder metadata are nevertheless the authoring prototypes selected by `page_layouts`.

When `create-template` used project output scope, its workspace root is the target project itself and all core directories are already final. Resolve both roots before copying: equality means **in-place consumption**, so skip the installation. An in-place workspace cannot participate in multi-path fusion; use external workspaces for fusion. Never place the local source under a nested `templates/local_master/` directory because the confirmation and quality gates read the project `templates/` root.

A project-scoped workspace has the same portable routing as a library workspace. It may be copied or promoted across roots as one unit (`templates/` plus any existing `images/` and `icons/`); `exports/` stays review-only. Do not pass only another project's `templates/` subdirectory because that would omit sibling assets.

Legacy template packages may ship `native_structure.json` + `source_template.pptx`, omit root Master identity, use direct atomic placeholders, or carry old baseline/distillation metadata. Do not copy or consume those semantic contracts through Step 3. Run [`restore-pptx-structure`](workflows/restore-pptx-structure.md) on the package first, then return with the migrated workspace path. Old flat packaging remains readable when its SVG structure is already current.

The Strategist confirmation stage decides whether the selected deck/layout template is used `strict` or `adaptive`. Those template projects use `pptx_structure.mode: structured`, map every page to one input SVG in `page_layouts`, declare unique reusable identities in `pptx_masters` / `pptx_layouts`, and assign each page through `page_pptx_layouts` before SVG generation. A Layout definition may remain unused by generated pages when it names an installed template SVG as its prototype source. Brand-only projects remain on the free-design `mode: flat` route. Strict preserves the template's declared Master/Layout/slot contract. Adaptive keeps the template Master and may define and assign a new Layout key during authoring when the composition genuinely changes. Non-mirror paint and typography follow the project skin rules.

#### Multi-path fusion

When the user gives two or more paths of **different kinds**, Step 3 fuses them into a single `<project>/templates/design_spec.md`. **Default granularity is segment-level integer replacement** — entire identity / structure / middle segments are taken from the highest-priority source for that segment, no implicit field-level mixing.

Override priority by segment:

| Combination | Identity from | Structure from | Middle from |
|---|---|---|---|
| brand only | brand | (free design) | (none) |
| layout only | (free design) | layout | (none) |
| deck only | deck | deck | deck |
| brand + layout | brand | layout | (none) |
| brand + deck | brand (overrides deck) | deck | deck |
| layout + deck | deck | layout (overrides deck) | deck |
| brand + layout + deck | brand | layout | deck |

Field-level micro-adjustment (e.g. "use anthropic brand but primary changed to #FF0000") is **not** part of Step 3 fusion — it flows into Strategist confirmation stage e–g as a normal user request.

#### Same-kind multiple paths — conflict resolution

When the user gives two paths of the **same kind** (e.g. `brands/anthropic` + `brands/google`), Step 3 surfaces a conflict prompt before fusing — like resolving a git merge conflict:

```
AI: 你给了两个 brand，检测到段级冲突：
    - Color Scheme（Anthropic 橙红 vs Google 多色）
    - Typography（Styrene/AnthropicSans vs GoogleSans/Roboto）
    - Logo（Anthropic 标 vs Google 标）
    - Voice & Tone（restrained vs friendly）
    - Icon Style（stroke vs filled）

    要 (a) 全部按 Anthropic / (b) 全部按 Google / (c) 逐段挑？
```

Rules:
- Default: no implicit ordering — every cross-source segment difference is reported as a conflict
- Only when the user picks `(c)` does AI walk through each segment one by one
- Field-level conflicts are out of scope — segment-level only
- Three or more same-kind paths are not supported — ask the user to converge to at most two

#### Fused spec provenance

When fusion happens (any multi-path case), the resulting `<project>/templates/design_spec.md` carries a provenance block immediately under its H1:

```markdown
> **Fused from:**
> - deck: `templates/decks/中国电信/` （base）
> - brand: `templates/brands/anthropic/` （identity override）
> - layout: `templates/layouts/presentation_core/` （structure override）
> - conflicts resolved: Color Scheme from anthropic（user picked a）
```

Single-path Step 3 does **not** add provenance (the source is self-evident from the copied files).

The fused frontmatter `kind` describes the resulting bundle: `deck` when both identity and structure are present, `layout` when only structure is present, and `brand` when only identity is present. Keep this field accurate; the Strategist confirmation server uses it to show template adherence only for bundles that actually own page structure.

**✅ Checkpoint — Default path proceeds to Step 4 without user interaction. If the user supplied one or more explicit template paths, those have been copied, staged in place, or fused into `<project_path>/templates/` before advancing.**

---

### Step 4: Strategist Phase (MANDATORY — cannot be skipped)

🚧 **GATE**: Step 3 complete; default free-design path taken, or (if triggered) template files copied or confirmed in place in the project.

First, read the role definition:
```
Read references/strategist.md
```

> ⚠️ **Mandatory gate**: before writing `design_spec.md`, Strategist MUST `read_file templates/design_spec_reference.md` and follow its full I–X section structure. See `strategist.md` Section 1.

**Artifact ownership**: fact-channel and source/derived artifact boundaries are defined in [`references/artifact-ownership.md`](references/artifact-ownership.md). This Step uses those ownership rules; it does not redefine them.

**`<project_path>/analysis/` is the project's intermediate-analysis folder: the canonical home for machine-extracted source/asset facts — the PPTX intake bundle (`source_profile.json` index + per-deck `<stem>.identity.json` / `<stem>.slide_library.json`) and `image_analysis.csv`. It holds facts, not design contracts — `design_spec.md` / `spec_lock.md` stay at the project root.** The MUST-read contract covers only the **compact structured data files (`.json` / `.csv`)**; other artifacts that may live under `analysis/` (e.g. a beautify `source_svg_import/` vector reference package) are NOT bulk-read — they are read selectively only when a specific workflow step calls for them. Before the Strategist confirmation stage, Strategist MUST read the auto-extracted fact files already in `analysis/` — currently `source_profile.json` (PPTX intake), when present. This file is the multi-deck index: read it once for the `decks[]` digests (canvas / chart / table / SmartArt entries per source deck), then open a specific deck's `<stem>.identity.json` / `<stem>.slide_library.json` only if you need its full raw facts. Use these entries as **factual source context** (format default + content facts); when several decks are present, synthesize across all of them. The source's **palette / typography / visual identity are a reference, not a constraint**: the main pipeline may inherit them where they fit the content and the confirmed style, or design fresh where they don't — the Strategist's judgment, never an obligation to either keep or discard. (Template-fill preserves the native source design by editing cloned slides directly; beautify defaults to the source identity but still follows the confirmed values; the main pipeline treats source identity as reference only and defaults to fresh design.) (`image_analysis.csv` lands later, at the image-analysis step below, and is the authoritative regenerated image-fact view there — re-derived from the live `images/` folder, not a durable store.)

**Channel ownership — read each fact once from its owning channel.** In the main pipeline the **content contract is the content-type files in `sources/`** — primarily `<stem>.md`, but also any user-supplied content the import archived there: `.md` / `.markdown` / `.txt` / `.csv` / `.tsv` / `.json` / `.jsonl` / `.yaml` / `.yml` (a `metrics.json` or `data.csv` may carry core content — judge by what the file holds). Text, tables, chart data values, and SmartArt node wording come from these (`ppt_to_md` transcribes native charts as Markdown tables and SmartArt nodes as hierarchical bullets). **Do NOT read pipeline sidecars in `sources/` as content**: `*.conversion_profile.json` (conversion audit) and `*_files/image_manifest.json` (asset index) are process metadata — open them only to audit a conversion or resolve assets, never as slide content. Converted-source originals archived in `sources/` (`.pdf` / `.pptx` / `.docx` / `.xlsx` / `.html` / `.epub` / `.tex` / `.rst` / `.ipynb` / `.typ`, etc.) are read via their converted `<stem>.md`, not scanned directly in the main pipeline. The `analysis/` chart / table / diagram entries are a **structural digest** for outline decisions (which slides carried charts, tables, or SmartArt; chart types / series names; SmartArt layout and hierarchy) — not a second copy of the content values; do NOT also pull chart values or SmartArt wording from `<stem>.slide_library.json` in the main pipeline. The `<stem>.slide_library.json` full structured data is owned by the direct-PPTX workflows: template-fill uses it as the native fill contract while preserving SmartArt unchanged; beautify uses it for native chart / table data and SmartArt relationships while keeping all wording from the Markdown.

**Content-planning confirmation** (full contracts: [`airi-workflow-wizard.md`](workflows/airi-workflow-wizard.md) and [`confirm_ui.md`](scripts/docs/confirm_ui.md)):

⛔ **BLOCKING 1 — style + analysis plan**:

1. Present every registered `visual_style` as a thumbnail. Badge the Strategist recommendation, but do not preselect it. If the user says "随便" / equivalent or continues without picking, apply the recommendation and record `visual_style_source: auto`; otherwise record `user`.
2. Require an explicit `analysis_required: true | false`. A missing domain is never an implicit No.
3. When true, ask the user for exactly one domain — architecture / interior / landscape / planning — plus one analysis-library style. After the domain is selected, read its complete ordered item list from `analysis_types.json`, state the total, list every item with its stable id and user-facing name, and ask: "Generate all N items? If not, reply with the ids to exclude." This remains inside BLOCKING 1: do not generate until the user explicitly confirms all or supplies exclusions. Default the confirmed set to the full domain and remove only user-excluded ids; never auto-filter, rank, recommend, or reduce the set from source material. Persist the resulting `analysis_item_ids` with `analysis_domain_id`; an empty runtime selection resolves to the domain's full item list for compatibility. Generate only through `analysis_library.py` + the selected provider profile. Keep professional analysis images separate from cover / decorative / photographic image policy. If a requested type lacks measured source data, keep it selected but frame the output as a source-grounded conceptual diagram and do not invent measurements, simulation results, performance claims, or compliance conclusions.

🚧 **POST-ANALYSIS GATE — content inventory before page count**:

1. Wait until every requested analysis image is `Generated` and present on disk; an explicit No skips generation.
2. Build `analysis/content_inventory.json` from source facts, user images, generated analysis images, actual aspect ratios, intended full/half/combined placement, copy blocks, and presentation density.
3. Write `recommended_page_count` plus `page_count_rationale` only now. Never ask the user to lock page count earlier; `len(outline_draft.pages)` becomes the working and final count.

⛔ **BLOCKING 2 — page outline**: write the sourced page cards only after the inventory is current, present them for add/delete/reorder/copy/image edits, and wait for explicit confirmation. Every page carries `source_refs`; every image carries `source`. Any upstream change invalidates the inventory and confirmation. Any outline edit invalidates only the confirmation.

The reusable numbered contact sheets in `assets/contact-sheets/` are the default visual surface. Show them in chat and execute the same two blocking decisions in the same order. Use the browser wizard only when the user explicitly asks for it. Do not use the legacy three-stage `/confirm` sequence for new/restructured decks.

**Legacy performance-image compatibility**: for old `/confirm` projects, `result.json` remains authoritative. Its `image_usage` governs only cover / decorative / photographic acquisition; it never substitutes for schema-v4 `analysis_required`. Map it to §VIII `Acquire Via` as follows:

| `result.json.image_usage` | §VIII `Acquire Via` | h.5 + Step 5 generation |
|---|---|---|
| `ai` | `ai` rows | Run h.5 (lock rendering + palette); Step 5 generates |
| `web` | `web` rows | None |
| `provided` | **`user`** rows | None — never generate |
| `placeholder` | `placeholder` rows | None |
| `none` | no image rows (§h option A) | None |
| Legacy custom prose | Infer the intended rows from the prose | Run h.5 only if the prose includes AI |

When the confirmed `image_usage` does not include `ai` (and no legacy custom prose includes AI), do **NOT** run h.5, do **NOT** write `ai` rows, and do **NOT** generate images in Step 5 — regardless of what you recommended. `none` is exclusive: if confirmed, write no §VIII image rows. The same "confirmed value wins" rule applies to every field (color → §III, typography → §IV, etc.).

**Small spot illustrations are a Strategist judgment, not a confirmation field.** The user chooses image *source* through `image_usage`; whether the deck leans into decorative illustrations is anchored by the locked `visual_style`'s **illustration propensity** (`core` / `supportive` / `sparse`), expressed only in the `image_notes` rationale — never a new confirmation control. An explicit user request to use or skip illustrations overrides that default either way; `image_usage: none` still wins (write no illustration rows); and source still comes from `image_usage` — a `core` style does not silently generate AI spots when the user did not pick AI. They are ordinary §VIII image rows (`Type: Illustration` / `Illustration Sheet`) using normal `Acquire Via` values. If the plan needs ≥3 same-family AI spot illustrations, use the `ai` Illustration Sheet + `slice` workflow by default; do not generate one AI image per spot. Full rule + precedence: [`references/strategist.md`](references/strategist.md) §h. Use them on suitable pages and omit them where they would weaken clarity.

**Upstream override → invalidate and re-derive (Mandatory).** When sources, visual style, professional-analysis decision/selection, provider profile, reference images, or generated analysis files change, treat `analysis/content_inventory.json` and the outline confirmation as stale. Rebuild the inventory before revising the outline. A user-confirmed field is never silently recomputed; only untouched dependent recommendations are re-derived.

| Anchor the user changed | Re-derive (only the downstream fields the user left at your recommendation) |
|---|---|
| `visual_style` (§d Layer 2 — anchors e–h) | color neutral tiers (§e), icon library / stroke (§f), typography character (§g), image rendering (§h.5) |
| `mode` (§d Layer 1) | outline structure + register (§IX) |
| `delivery_purpose` (§g) | body baseline + per-page density / rhythm (§6.1) |
| `audience` / core message (§c) | tone across e–h, outline emphasis (§IX) |
| `color` HEX (§e) | h.5 palette (re-filter for the new HEX) |

Reconcile **without a new blocking wait** — fold the coherent values into `design_spec.md` / `spec_lock.md` and state the adjustment in the §8 next-step handoff (e.g. "you switched to `dark-tech`; the light palette you had left no longer fit, so background / accent were re-derived — tell me if you wanted the original"). Canvas is the explicit exception: font sizes are deliberately **not** rescaled on a canvas change (see strategist §g).

**Browser opt-in**: chat contact sheets are the default. Only when the user explicitly requests the browser page, run the same ordered style gallery → explicit analysis decision → analysis generation/skip → content inventory → sourced page-outline confirmation there. Do not restore early page-count confirmation.

The page is a **confirmation surface only** — Strategist still authors every recommendation; the page never generates content.

**Mandatory — split-mode note** (not a separate confirmation): after the content inventory has produced the page-count recommendation, append one short line about generation mode. Pick the variant by page count, source-material bulk, and research load:

| Signal read | Line content |
|---|---|
| Heavy (long page count / bulky sources / heavy web-fetch accumulation) | State estimated page count and large source size; recommend switching to [split mode](workflows/resume-execute.md) after Step 5 — stop this chat, open a fresh window and input `继续生成 projects/<project_name>` to enter the execution session (SVG generation + export); no response or "continue" = default continuous mode. |
| Normal (default) | State scale is moderate, default continuous mode generates in one go; if mid-way window switch is desired, input `继续生成 projects/<project_name>` after Step 5 to switch to [split mode](workflows/resume-execute.md). |

This line is required after the post-analysis page-count recommendation. Whether to act on it is the user's call; record the choice in the project handoff rather than using an early page-count screen.

**Mandatory — spec-refinement note** (not a separate confirmation): after the split-mode line, tell the user they may run [refine-spec](workflows/refine-spec.md) after outline confirmation and before SVG generation. Default is OFF.

**Formula rendering policy lives inside item 7 (Typography plan)**:

| Policy | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `mixed` (default) | Strategist renders complex formula-worthy expressions as PNG assets; simple inline expressions remain editable text / Unicode |
| `render-all` | Strategist renders every formula-worthy expression as PNG assets |
| `text-only` | No formula rendering; formulas remain editable text / Unicode |

After the Strategist confirmation stage is approved and **before outputting `design_spec.md` / `spec_lock.md`**, if the confirmed formula policy is `mixed` or `render-all` and the content contains formula-worthy expressions, Strategist MUST:

1. Identify explicit LaTeX and any source expressions that should be faithfully structured as formulas.
2. Write `<project_path>/images/formula_manifest.json` with only the formulas selected for rendering.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/latex_render.py <project_path>
   ```
4. Include the rendered formula PNGs as `Acquire Via: formula`, `Status: Rendered`, `Type: Latex Formula` rows in `design_spec.md §VIII Image Resource List`; also list them in `spec_lock.md images` with `| no-crop`.

The formula renderer uses a provider fallback chain by default: `codecogs,quicklatex,mathpad,wikimedia`. The first three are color-aware; Wikimedia is an availability fallback. Formula PNGs are transparent by default: manifest `background` is the temporary render matte and transparency-removal reference, not a retained final background unless `transparent: false` is set for that item. Do not scan `spec_lock.md` for `$...$` or `$$...$$`. Dollar-delimited math in source material is only a signal for Strategist; the renderer consumes the explicit manifest.

If the user provided images or formula PNGs were rendered, run analysis **before outputting the design spec**. It writes `analysis/image_analysis.csv` — the authoritative regenerated image-fact view in the `analysis/` folder, which MUST be read before authoring §VIII:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images
```

> 🔁 **Image facts are regenerated on demand, never a durable store.** `images/` is a live working folder — pictures are extracted from the source at import, the user may drop or replace files at any time, and Step 5 writes web/AI images into it. The single source of truth is therefore the **current contents of `images/`**, and `analysis/image_analysis.csv` is a *regenerated view* of it, not a fact to keep in sync. Re-run `analyze_images.py <project_path>/images` immediately **before any step that reads image facts** so the view reflects the live folder: before the §h image-usage recommendation (see [strategist.md](references/strategist.md) §h), here before authoring §VIII, after Step 5 acquisition (so web/AI files join the view), and again any time the user says they added or replaced images. This is the staleness strategy — re-derive on use, no cache to invalidate.

> ⚠️ **Image handling**: NEVER directly read / open / view image files (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.). All image info comes from `analyze_images.py` output (`analysis/image_analysis.csv`) or the Design Spec's Image Resource List.

#### Schema-v4 Content Inventory + Outline Gate

Every new/restructured deck MUST write schema-v4 `workflow_selection.json` and apply this gate before `design_spec.md` / `spec_lock.md`:

1. Save `visual_style_source`, explicit `analysis_required`, `analysis_selection_confirmed`, and `analysis_selection_hash`.
2. When analysis is required, generate every selected item and require the image manifest hash plus every output file to match. When false, skip professional-analysis generation explicitly.
3. After analysis is ready, POST or write `analysis/content_inventory.json` with the current `planning_input_hash`, `recommended_page_count`, `page_count_rationale`, source-backed content blocks, image facts, and placement recommendations.
4. Write schema-v3 `outline_draft.json` from the current inventory. Each page needs `source_refs`; each image needs `source`.
5. ⛔ **BLOCKING**: wait for explicit final outline confirmation. Any upstream change makes the inventory/confirmation stale; any draft edit invalidates the confirmation.
6. Run `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outline_gate.py check <project_path>`. It is the single generation-unlock gate. Only after it passes may Strategist write the final spec and Executor start.

Analysis generation defaults to `gptimage2.0-1K-mid` (GPT Image 2, 1K, medium). In chat the user may instead select `nanobanana-pro-2K` (Gemini 3 Pro Image / Nano Banana Pro, 2K). Both profiles support reference images and must pass `image_gen.py --dry-run` before a paid run.

**Output**:
- `<project_path>/design_spec.md` — human-readable design narrative
- `<project_path>/spec_lock.md` — machine-readable execution contract (skeleton: `templates/spec_lock_reference.md`); Executor re-reads before every page

**✅ Checkpoint — Phase deliverables complete, auto-proceed to next step**:
```markdown
## ✅ Strategist Phase Complete
- [x] Read the auto-extracted facts already in `analysis/` (e.g. `source_profile.json`) before the Strategist confirmation stage
- [x] Visual style chosen/auto-accepted and professional-analysis Yes/No confirmed
- [x] Requested professional analysis images generated, or explicit No recorded
- [x] Current content inventory written with post-analysis page-count rationale
- [x] Sourced page outline explicitly confirmed
- [x] Split-mode note appended below the confirmation fields (heavy or normal variant)
- [x] Spec-refinement opt-in line appended (default OFF; only the user's explicit request enters the refine-spec workflow)
- [x] Design Specification & Content Outline generated
- [x] Execution lock (spec_lock.md) generated
- [ ] **Next**: Auto-proceed to [Image_Generator / Executor] phase
```

---

### Step 5: Image Acquisition Phase (Conditional)

🚧 **GATE**: Step 4 complete; Design Specification & Content Outline generated and user confirmed. Any formula rows already have `Acquire Via: formula` and `Status: Rendered`.

> **Trigger**: At least one row in the resource list has `Acquire Via: ai`, `web`, and/or `slice`. If every row is `user`, `formula`, or `placeholder`, skip to Step 6.

**Failure recovery**: stop/continue behavior for AI/web/slice/image-readiness failures is defined in [`workflows/failure-recovery.md`](workflows/failure-recovery.md). This Step keeps the acquisition procedure.

**Always load the common framework**:

```
Read references/image-base.md
```

Then **lazy-load the path-specific reference** for each row that actually needs it:

| Acquire Via | Load reference (only if any such row exists) | Run |
|---|---|---|
| `ai` | `references/image-generator.md` | write `<project_path>/images/image_prompts.json`, then follow `image-generator.md §7 Path Selection` (`image_gen.py --manifest` is **Path A only**) |
| `web` | `references/image-searcher.md` | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/image_search.py ...` (≥2 web rows → `--batch images/image_queries.json`) |
| `slice` | `references/image-generator.md` §4.3 | derived — **after** the parent `ai` sheet row is `Generated`, run `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/slice_images.py <project_path>/images/<sheet>.png --grid RxC --names ... --trim --alpha` (see workflow step 2.5) |
| `user` / `formula` / `placeholder` | (skip) | (skip) |

A deck with only `ai` rows never loads `image-searcher.md`; a deck with only `web` rows never loads `image-generator.md`. A mixed deck loads both, processes each row through its own path, and writes both `image_prompts.json` and `image_sources.json`.

> ⚠️ **In-pipeline ai rows MUST use the manifest contract** — even when only 1 ai row exists. Always write `images/image_prompts.json` first and render `image_prompts.md` with `image_gen.py --render-md`. Then execute the confirmed path from `image-generator.md §7`: `image_gen.py --manifest` is **Path A only**; `host-native` is **Path B** and MUST skip `--manifest`; `manual` writes the prompts and stops for external generation. The positional form (`image_gen.py "prompt" ...`) is reserved for **out-of-pipeline one-off testing / single-image fixups** — it skips manifest + sidecar, leaving no audit trail.

> ⚠️ **web path — batch multiple rows**: when ≥2 rows are `Acquire Via: web`, write all queries into `images/image_queries.json` and run `image_search.py --batch` once (concurrent acquisition, status written back), instead of one CLI call per row. A single web row may use the positional single-query form. See [image-searcher.md](references/image-searcher.md) §5.

> 💡 **ai path — spot illustrations as one sheet**: when the §VIII image resource plan needs ≥3 same-family spot illustrations as decorative accessories, generate **one grid sheet** (a single `ai` sheet row) instead of one row per element, then slice it (workflow step 2.5 below). Choose sheet geometry from intended placement: `1xN` / `Nx1` are useful for extreme portrait / landscape cells, and a designed `MxN` grid is valid when its cell ratio fits the planned elements. The sheet row is generated but not placed; each cut **element row** (`Acquire Via: slice`) is placed and must appear in `spec_lock.md images`. One generation = one coherent style across all pieces. Resource contract + the geometry rules: [image-generator.md](references/image-generator.md) §4.3.

> ⚠️ **Honor the confirmed image source before running any generation command**: the `ai` generation path (Path A = `image_gen.py` API / Path B = host-native tool / Offline Manual) is **not** auto-only — a confirmed choice other than `auto` wins, whether it came from chat (canonical) or, when the page was used, `result.json.image_ai_path`. `host-native` forces Path B even when `IMAGE_BACKEND` is configured; `api` forces Path A; `manual` forces offline. Never run `image_gen.py --manifest` when the confirmed value is `host-native` or `manual`. Full selection rule: [image-generator.md](references/image-generator.md) §7 Path Selection.

Workflow:

1. Extract all resource rows from the design spec and group them by `Acquire Via`; rows with `Status: Pending` or `Status: Failed` and `Acquire Via ∈ {ai, web, slice}` must all reach a terminal state before Executor starts
2. Generate prompts (ai rows) and/or run search (web rows) per [image-base.md](references/image-base.md) §3 dispatch table
2.5. **Slice any spot-illustration sheets (only if `slice` rows exist).** For each generated `ai` **sheet** row, run `slice_images.py` (grid + the element `--names` matching the `slice` rows, `--trim --alpha`) so every element file lands in `images/`; mark each `slice` row `Generated`. A sheet still in `Needs-Manual` cannot be sliced — leave its `slice` rows `Needs-Manual` and surface them at the Step 7 readiness gate. Contract: [image-generator.md](references/image-generator.md) §4.3.
3. Verify every row reaches a terminal status: `Generated` (ai success / sliced element), `Sourced` (web success), or `Needs-Manual`. `Failed` is not a terminal status: it means the current run did not generate that item, but the item remains retryable. The agent must resolve every residual `Failed` item by rerunning the confirmed path or marking it `Needs-Manual` before Executor starts
4. Re-derive image facts now that web / AI / sliced files are in the folder — `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images` — so `analysis/image_analysis.csv` reflects every acquired image **including the sliced elements** (real measured sizes) before the Executor lays them out. Image facts are regenerated on use, never a stale store (see Step 4's image-facts note).

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm acquisition attempted for every row**:
```markdown
## ✅ Image Acquisition Phase Complete
- [x] image_prompts.json created (when any ai rows processed)
- [x] image_prompts.md sidecar rendered (when any ai rows processed)
- [x] image_sources.json created (when any web rows processed)
- [x] Spot-illustration sheets sliced (when any `slice` rows exist); every element file present in `images/` and listed in `spec_lock.md images`
- [x] Each row: status is `Generated` / `Sourced` / `Needs-Manual` (no `Pending` or `Failed` remaining)
- [x] analyze_images.py re-run so image_analysis.csv covers the acquired web / AI / sliced images
```

**Default — auto-proceed to Step 6 after `outline_gate.py check` passes.** Only when the user explicitly opted into split mode after seeing the post-analysis page count, output the planning-session handoff below and stop this conversation:

  ```markdown
  ## ✅ Planning Session Complete
  - [x] Spec: `design_spec.md`, `spec_lock.md`
  - [x] Resources: `sources/`, `images/`, `templates/`
  - [ ] **Next**: open a fresh chat window and input `继续生成 projects/<project_name>` to enter the execution session via the [`resume-execute`](workflows/resume-execute.md) workflow.
  ```

> On acquisition failure, do NOT halt — follow the Failure Handling rule in [image-base.md](references/image-base.md) §5: retry once, then mark the row `Needs-Manual`, report to user, and continue to the checkpoint above.

---

### Step 6: Executor Phase

Run `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outline_gate.py check <project_path>` before starting live preview. Schema-v4 projects must pass every workflow gate; existence of files alone is insufficient. Legacy schema-v3 projects retain their prior outline compatibility behavior.

🚧 **GATE**: Step 4 (and Step 5 if triggered) complete; all prerequisite deliverables are ready.

**Artifact ownership**: `svg_output/` is the author source, `svg_final/` is derived, and image facts come from the regenerated `analysis/image_analysis.csv`; see [`references/artifact-ownership.md`](references/artifact-ownership.md).

Read the execution references for this deck's locked `mode` + `visual_style` (from `spec_lock.md`):
```
Read references/executor-base.md                  # REQUIRED: common guidelines
Read references/shared-standards.md               # REQUIRED: SVG/PPT technical constraints
Read references/native-shape-authoring.md         # REQUIRED: stock-shape selection and fragment helper contract
Read references/modes/<locked-mode>.md            # narrative skeleton (spec_lock.md `mode`)
Read references/visual-styles/<locked-style>.md   # aesthetic (spec_lock.md `visual_style`)
```

> Read executor-base + shared-standards + native-shape-authoring + the one locked mode file + the one locked visual-style file. For `mode: custom` or `visual_style: custom`, skip that preset file and follow `mode_behavior` / `visual_style_behavior` from `spec_lock.md` instead. Never glob `modes/` or `visual-styles/`.

**Design Parameter Confirmation (Mandatory)**: before the first SVG, output key design parameters from the spec (canvas dimensions, color scheme, font plan, body font size). See executor-base.md §2.

**Live Preview Auto-Startup (Mandatory)**: before the first SVG, automatically start the browser editor in live mode and keep it running continuously through Executor + Step 7 export:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_editor/server.py <project_path> --live --daemon
```
- Start it immediately when Executor begins; `svg_output/` may be empty. Editor opens at the launch-log URL such as `http://127.0.0.1:5050`; if another project already holds it, the launcher **auto-advances to the next free port** — read the actual URL from the launch log and report that.
- Treat the launch URL as a checkpoint value: before writing the first SVG, either report the actual URL from the launcher or state the launch failure explicitly. Do not silently continue while claiming preview is available.
- Run it as a long-running side process/session; do not wait for it to exit before generating SVG pages. Do not wait for user confirmation after startup.
- **Service must keep running** until one of: (a) the user clicks **Exit preview** in the browser, or (b) the user explicitly asks in chat to stop it. Generation continues even if the user closes the editor.
- **Do NOT read or apply submitted annotations during generation.** Users may annotate at any time, but Executor proceeds without touching them. The window to apply annotations opens only after Step 7 completes — see [`workflows/live-preview.md`](workflows/live-preview.md).
- The editor also supports **staged direct edits** (text content + SVG element attributes previewed immediately, then written to `svg_output/` only when the user clicks **Apply changes**; `Ctrl+Z` / Undo drops staged edits) alongside annotation; re-export stays chat-driven. Full scope and editor details: see [`workflows/live-preview.md`](workflows/live-preview.md) Notes.

**Pre-generation Batch Read (Mandatory)**: before the first SVG, batch-read every distinct layout SVG referenced in `spec_lock.page_layouts` and every distinct chart SVG referenced in `spec_lock.page_charts` (plus any §VII backup charts). One read per file, up front — do not re-read these during page generation. See executor-base.md §1.0.

> Image facts: trust the `analysis/image_analysis.csv` regenerated at the end of Step 5. If `images/` changed since (the user swapped or added files), re-run `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images` before laying images out — facts are re-derived on use, never a stale store (Step 4 image-facts note).

**Per-page spec_lock re-read (Mandatory)**: before **each** SVG page, `read_file <project_path>/spec_lock.md` and use only its colors / fonts / icons / images, plus `pptx_structure.mode` and the per-page `page_rhythm` / `page_charts` lookups. Read `page_layouts` / `page_pptx_layouts` / `pptx_masters` / `pptx_layouts` only on a structured deck/layout template route; they are absent in flat free-design and brand-only projects. Resists context-compression drift on long decks. See executor-base.md §2.1.

> ⚠️ **Main-agent only**: SVG generation MUST stay in the current main agent — page design depends on full upstream context. Do NOT delegate to sub-agents.
> ⚠️ **Generation rhythm**: generate pages sequentially, one at a time, in the same continuous context. Do NOT batch (e.g., 5 per group).

**Visual Construction Phase**: generate SVG pages sequentially, one at a time, in one continuous pass → `<project_path>/svg_output/`

Each completed SVG MUST be a standalone, complete representation of that slide's visible design. Template SVGs and locked planning artifacts may guide construction, but export must not reach back to them to add visible objects omitted from `svg_output/`. Speaker notes, animation, narration, transitions, and direct native-PPTX workflows remain separately owned artifacts/capabilities. Before drawing a literal stock shape, apply [`native-shape-authoring.md`](references/native-shape-authoring.md): use the stdout-only helper when one PowerPoint preset exactly matches, keep basic SVG primitives for rect/round-rect/ellipse, and keep free SVG for custom semantics. Diagram relationships are Shape-first: use ordinary line/path shapes with registered arrow markers for thin edges and ordinary shape presets for solid block arrows; do not default to connector-family presets or author attachment metadata. Never infer a preset from contour similarity.

Template pages MUST start from the complete `page_layouts` SVG, keep all inherited visible objects in `svg_output/`, and preserve the locked root Master/Layout identity plus stable atomic Master/Layout and slot ids. Strict keeps the prototype structure unchanged. Adaptive keeps its Master contract and, when Layout atoms or slot topology/bounds genuinely evolve, assigns a new key/name and updates `spec_lock.md` immediately. Non-mirror fill/stroke/effects/font sizes still follow `spec_lock`.

Free-design and brand-only pages use `pptx_structure.mode: flat`. Draw the complete page directly: keep backgrounds, repeated chrome, headings, text, images, and decoration as ordinary Slide-local SVG content. Do not plan `pptx_masters` / `pptx_layouts` / `page_pptx_layouts`, do not add root Master/Layout identity, and do not add `data-pptx-layer` or `data-pptx-placeholder` metadata. Group logical content normally with top-level `<g id>` elements. Export materializes one clean project-owned Master plus one Blank Layout, applies the locked theme colors/fonts/title-body defaults, removes stock content placeholders and unused built-in Layouts, and retains only the standard date/footer/slide-number capability hooks. It does not promote or deduplicate page content.

Do not duplicate specialized identity with `data-pptx-role`. Add it only to structural page-frame objects whose package, page-number, or animation behavior is not already expressed by `data-pptx-layer`, `data-pptx-placeholder`, or `data-pptx-replace-with`; such an element needs a stable unique `id`. Do not add generic content roles to ordinary titles, body text, cards, KPIs, diagrams, charts, icons, or images. Full contract: [`references/semantic-svg.md`](references/semantic-svg.md).

**First-page gate (Mandatory)** — after the **first** SVG page, before drawing page 2:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_quality_checker.py <project_path>/svg_output/<first_page>.svg
```
Fix every `error` on page 1 first — structural violations are systematic, and a first-page error repeated deck-wide costs a whole-deck rewrite.

**Quality Check Gate (Mandatory)** — after all SVGs, BEFORE annotation handling and speaker notes:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_quality_checker.py <project_path>
```
- Any `error` (banned/unsupported SVG features, invalid values, unresolved references, viewBox mismatch, etc.) MUST be fixed before proceeding — return to Visual Construction, regenerate that page, re-run check.
- Every `warning` is advisory and non-blocking: do not return the page for mandatory modification, do not auto-normalize user-authored compatible syntax, and do not require an acknowledgement/disposition line. Recommendation warnings identify the generated-SVG default; fidelity/quality warnings may be reported when material, but the existing input may ship unchanged. If a condition must be corrected before release, the checker must classify it as an `error`, not a `warning`.
- The same rule applies to structured-template warnings (empty/framing-only Layout, bare Master, duplicate layout keys): they may guide an optional template cleanup, but warnings alone never fail the quality gate. Flat free-design and brand-only routes still rely on their existing hard errors for invalid structure metadata or incomplete required locks.
- Run against `svg_output/` (not after `finalize_svg.py` — finalize rewrites SVG and masks violations).

**Logic Construction Phase**: generate speaker notes → `<project_path>/notes/total.md`

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm all SVGs and notes are fully generated and quality-checked. Run the applicable conditional gates below, then proceed to Step 7**:
```markdown
## ✅ Executor Phase Complete
- [x] Live preview started before the first SVG and kept available at the reported URL
- [x] First-page gate run after page 1 (errors fixed before page 2)
- [x] All SVGs generated to svg_output/
- [x] svg_quality_checker.py passed (0 errors)
- [x] Speaker notes generated at notes/total.md
```

> **Chart pages?** If this deck contains data charts (bar / line / pie / radar / etc.), run the standalone [`verify-charts`](workflows/verify-charts.md) workflow before Step 7 to calibrate coordinates. AI models routinely introduce 10–50 px errors when mapping data to pixel positions; verify-charts eliminates that class of error. Skip if no chart pages.

> **Visual self-check (opt-in)?** If the user explicitly asked for a per-page visual re-pass on the SVGs ("跑一下视觉自检 / 视觉回看", "visual review", "check pages visually", etc.), run the standalone [`visual-review`](workflows/visual-review.md) workflow before Step 7. Do NOT run it by default and do NOT recommend it based on inferred model capability or deck size — trigger is user request only.

---

### Step 7: Post-processing & Export

🚧 **GATE**: Step 6 complete; all SVGs generated to `svg_output/`; speaker notes `notes/total.md` generated.

🚧 **Image readiness GATE** (when Step 5 left ai rows in `Needs-Manual`): every expected file must exist at `project/images/<filename>` before running 7.1.

**Failure recovery**: if a Step 7 command fails, fix the owning source artifact and resume from the failed sub-step per [`workflows/failure-recovery.md`](workflows/failure-recovery.md). Do not restart the planning session unless the owning source changed.

> If files are missing: PAUSE, list the missing filenames, point the user to `images/image_prompts.md` (each `### Image N:` block is paste-ready for ChatGPT / Gemini / Midjourney; auto-generated from `image_prompts.json`) and the required placement `project/images/<filename>`. Resume Step 7.1 only after all expected files are in place. `finalize_svg.py` and `svg_to_pptx.py` do not detect missing files at this layer — proceeding with gaps produces a deck with broken image references.

> **Spot-illustration sheets at this gate**: `slice` element files are **derived**, not placed by the user. If a sheet was `Needs-Manual` (offline), the element files do not exist yet — list the **sheet** filename (`images/<sheet>.png`) plus its element target names, and instruct: place the sheet, then run the Step 5 `slice_images.py` command for it, then re-run `analyze_images.py`, before resuming 7.1. Never tell the user to hand-place the individual element files — they only come from slicing the sheet.

> ⚠️ Run the three sub-steps **one at a time** — each must complete successfully before the next.
> ❌ **NEVER** combine them into a single code block or shell invocation.

Canonical three-command pipeline (this step is the workflow authority;
`references/shared-standards.md` §5 points here):

**Step 7.1** — Split speaker notes:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/total_md_split.py <project_path>
```

**Step 7.2** — SVG post-processing (icon embedding / image crop & embed / raster image optimization / text flattening):
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/finalize_svg.py <project_path>
```
This mandatory step writes self-contained visual-preview SVGs to `svg_final/`. Those files may be opened directly or manually inserted into PowerPoint as SVG pictures. Default raster handling embeds images at the rendered SVG size budget (`--image-scale 2`, `--max-dimension 2560`); opaque PNG photos may be written as JPEG, and transparent assets remain PNG. The existing EMF/WMF exception still applies: Office vector assets stay externally referenced for lossless native-PPTX passthrough, so the native PPTX remains the source of truth for pages that use them. Use `--no-compress` or a higher `--max-dimension` only for diagnostic / high-fidelity SVG previews.

**Step 7.3** — Export PPTX (embeds speaker notes by default):
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path>
# Output (default-flow mode):
#   exports/<project_name>_<timestamp>.pptx           ← native pptx (canonical output, reads svg_output/)
#   backup/<timestamp>/svg_output/                    ← Executor SVG source backup (always written)
# Add --native-charts-and-tables to replace marked fallbacks with PowerPoint-native Chart/Table objects:
#   exports/<project_name>_<timestamp>_native_charts_tables.pptx  ← native Chart/Table replacements (data-pptx-replace-with markers)
# Re-export with --recorded-narration audio (generate-audio workflow) embeds per-slide narration:
#   exports/<project_name>_<timestamp>_narrated.pptx  ← narrated pptx (embedded audio + auto-advance timings)
```

> The native pptx consumes `svg_output/` directly so the converter can preserve
> high-fidelity primitives (icon `<use>` placeholders, image `preserveAspectRatio`
> → native picture crop metadata, rounded rect `rx/ry` → `prstGeom roundRect`).
> Native raster images are optimized by default before writing `ppt/media`
> (`--image-sizing cap`, `--image-max-dimension 2560`, `--image-quality 85`).
> This optimization downscales only oversized full source images; it does not
> crop pixels out of embedded PPTX media, and it does not reduce a small
> placement image merely because it is currently displayed small. Display
> cropping remains editable PPT picture-crop metadata. Add `--no-image-optimize`
> only when the deck must retain original image bytes. Use
> `--image-sizing display --image-scale 2` only for aggressive size reduction.
> The `svg_output/`
> snapshot in `backup/<timestamp>/` is always written so the project can be
> re-exported from frozen SVG sources without re-running the LLM. The SVG-rendered
> preview remains the mandatory `svg_final/` artifact from Step 7.2; it is not
> packaged as a second PPTX. Use the default source selection for release
> exports. `-s final` is diagnostic-only
> when comparing conversion behavior against the post-processed SVGs; it does
> not change `svg_output/` ownership or establish a supported release route.

> **Supported PPTX boundary** — the only supported generated-PPTX path is
> `svg_output/` → the project SVG-to-DrawingML converter → native PPTX. The
> project does not emit an SVG-image PPTX and does not support PowerPoint's
> manual **Convert to Shape** operation on `svg_final/`. Inserted `svg_final/`
> pages remain ordinary SVG pictures unless the user independently accepts the
> results of an unsupported Office conversion.

> **PPTX structure mode** — release export reads the explicit route from
> `spec_lock.md`. Free-design and brand-only projects use
> `pptx_structure.mode: flat`, omit `pptx_masters` / `pptx_layouts` /
> `page_pptx_layouts` / `page_layouts`, and author no Master/Layout/layer/placeholder metadata in
> SVG. Export keeps every represented object Slide-local while materializing
> one clean project-owned Master and one Blank Layout from the current lock;
> stock content placeholders and unused built-in Layouts are removed; only the
> standard date/footer/slide-number capability hooks remain.
>
> Deck/layout template projects use `pptx_structure.mode: structured`, a
> complete `pptx_masters` roster, one unique `pptx_layouts` definition per
> reusable Layout, and exactly one `page_pptx_layouts` assignment per page.
> A Layout definition records Master key, PowerPoint picker name, and either a
> `P<NN>` or `template:<basename>` prototype source; an unused Layout uses a template prototype
> and is registered without a published carrier slide. Every SVG
> root repeats the Master/Layout keys and picker names. Master/Layout fixed
> visuals are direct root atoms; a `<g data-pptx-layer="master|layout">` is
> forbidden. Reusable slots are direct root `<g id>` elements with positive
> design-zone bounds and exactly one compatible carrier. A composite region
> uses only the explicit `object` + `proxy` fallback, and a Layout may
> intentionally have zero slots.
>
> Structured template export creates the declared Masters and Layouts,
> promotes the represented
> atoms, binds slot carriers, installs the locked theme/text defaults, and
> reopens the candidate package to verify Presentation → Master → Layout →
> Slide registration, picker names, static-object rosters, placeholder
> type/index/bounds, carrier bindings, hidden proxies, and zero-slot Layouts.
> It never selects pages, clusters visuals, promotes repeated chrome by
> heuristic, or invents missing structure. Legacy structured/template projects
> using `baseline`, `template`,
> `preserve`, `layout_strategy`, `data-pptx-layout-kind`,
> `distilled`/`utility`, direct atomic placeholders, or incomplete Master
> identity must run
> [`restore-pptx-structure`](workflows/restore-pptx-structure.md) before
> export.


> **Template structured export** — `page_layouts` records the complete
> input prototype per page, `pptx_masters` / `pptx_layouts` record the unique
> reusable output roster, and `page_pptx_layouts` records page assignment.
> Strict keeps the prototype
> Master/Layout/slot contract. Adaptive keeps its Master and may assign a new
> Layout identity during page authoring only when fixed Layout atoms or slot
> topology/bounds change; the lock is updated immediately. Non-mirror skin
> remains project-controlled, mirror preserves the reused visual identities,
> and the exporter never reads a template to add visible objects missing from
> `svg_output/`. Raw PPTX templates still route to `template-fill-pptx`;
> reusable template creation goes through `create-template`.

> **Paragraph editability vs line fidelity** — by default, mergeable dy-stacked
> paragraph blocks collapse into one editable PowerPoint text frame with multiple
> `<a:p>`, improving body-text editing and resize/reflow behavior. Add `--no-merge`
> only when the user explicitly asks for strict line-layout fidelity or when a
> layout-tight page must keep every dy-stacked line as its own text frame. The
> merge detector is conservative: adjacent lines with different effective font
> sizes retain a paragraph break, and mixed-layout text falls back to per-line frames.
> A multiline
> text carrier inside a slot must remain one native text frame; do not combine
> it with `--no-merge`. Strict-line text stays Slide-local rather than claiming
> one PowerPoint placeholder.

> **PowerPoint-native Chart/Table replacements** — supported data charts and pure text-grid
> tables carry `data-pptx-replace-with` markers by default (Executor transcribes
> them at draw time; see `references/executor-base.md` §3.2) and the markers
> stay dormant.
> Add `--native-charts-and-tables` only when the user explicitly wants
> data-backed PowerPoint-native Chart/Table objects and their object-specific
> editing controls, and accepts that those objects may
> render differently across PowerPoint / Keynote / LibreOffice / WPS; marker-local
> details not represented by the replacement payload may be omitted. This is a lossy
> data-object-first contract, not a reason to disable an otherwise supported
> marker. Without the flag, marked groups export through their SVG fallback
> children as independently editable DrawingML shapes. Imported objects that carry
> `data-pptx-replacement-status` are fallback-only; the quality checker and
> `--native-charts-and-tables` export surface their reason as warnings rather than silently
> claiming a native data object. An imported chart with no baked preview is a different
> case: `data-pptx-fallback-kind="placeholder"` records its
> reconstruction-only fallback.
> Default export keeps that placeholder with a warning; when the same group has
> a valid active `data-pptx-replace-with="chart"` payload,
> `--native-charts-and-tables` may still
> reconstruct the PowerPoint-native chart. Invalid or contradictory status declarations
> remain export errors. For supported parsed classic families, the importer
> instead emits a deterministic visible fallback with
> `data-pptx-fallback-kind="normalized"`; this is readable reconstruction, not
> a claim of Office pixel parity. Active imported table/chart markers also carry
> `data-pptx-import-source="pptx"` and
> `data-pptx-fallback-sha256`. If their fallback, reachable SVG fragment
> definition, local reference target, or marker transform changes later, default
> export keeps that SVG, the mandatory quality checker warns, and
> `--native-charts-and-tables` fails rather than discard the edit. Generated
> authoring and reusable templates omit import provenance and a static baseline;
> that hashless authored state is normal and does not warn. Hashless legacy
> imported markers that still carry PPTX import provenance remain
> native-compatible and only warn that stale detection is unavailable. Legacy
> `data-pptx-native*`, `data-pptx-visual-status`, and
> `data-pptx-route-status` spellings remain read-compatible; generated SVG uses
> only the canonical replacement/fallback attributes. `--native-objects`
> remains a compatibility alias for `--native-charts-and-tables`.
> Imported table markers may also cover the verified narrow P2 subset:
> exact physical row/grid topology, canonical rectangular merges with blank
> covered cells, safe per-side borders, plain multi-paragraph cells, and closed
> run-level rich text. A rich paragraph contains non-empty `runs`; each run
> requires `text` and may use only
> `bold` / `italic` / `underline` / `strike` / `color` / `font_size` /
> `font_family` / `lang` / `alt_lang`. Presentation-only source run XML without
> a non-empty `effectLst` / `effectDag` normalizes; a table-cell run effect
> disables native replacement and adds a blocking effect diagnostic.
> Relationship-bearing text, extensions, line breaks, fields, tabs, bullets,
> broken text topology, noncanonical merges, and unsafe direct formatting
> remain fallback-only. Imported classic charts
> additionally cover verified column/line/area combos, canonical OHLC stock,
> area date-axis cases, verified scatter/bubble axes, radar, safe `of_pie`
> `serLines`, and the closed axis/title/legend plus bar-gap/overlap normalization
> cases. The importer also accepts the seven closed ChartEx data models:
> treemap, sunburst, histogram, pareto, box-whisker, waterfall, and funnel.
> ChartEx data topology is retained for native read-back, but style, axis,
> labels, and binning details may normalize. These additions do not create a
> full `AxisSpec`, arbitrary ChartEx import, arbitrary rich OOXML, or new
> normalized-renderer coverage; unmodeled semantics continue to fail closed
> without reducing existing active-marker SVG-to-native conversion.

**Optional animation flags** (page transitions are on by default; per-element entrance is off by default — turn it on only when the user asks for it):
- `-t <effect>` — page transition. Default `fade`. Options: `fade` / `push` / `wipe` / `split` / `strips` / `cover` / `random` / `none`. `none` removes only the visual transition; an explicit automatic advance remains valid.
- `-a <effect>` — per-element entrance animation. **Default `none`** — pages appear as a whole, no auto-firing element builds (the unsolicited cascade reads as the "AI deck" tell). Opt in with `auto` (map effect from group id: chart→wipe, card-/step-/pillar-→fly, title/takeaway→fade; image-like ids `hero` / `figure-` / `image` / `img-` / `kpi` cycle a richer pool — zoom / dissolve / circle / box / diamond / wheel — so multiple images vary across the deck), a specific effect like `fade`, or `mixed` for the legacy 16-effect cycle. Requires top-level `<g id="...">` groups (already required by Executor).
- `--animation-trigger {on-click,with-previous,after-previous}` — Start mode (matches PowerPoint's animation-pane Start dropdown). Default `after-previous` (click-free cascade; pace via `--animation-stagger`). Use `on-click` for presenter-paced reveals, or `with-previous` for all-at-once.
- `--animation-config <path>` — optional object-level sidecar. Default: `<project_path>/animations.json` when present.
- `--auto-advance <seconds>` — kiosk-style auto-play. Click remains enabled, so click or timer may advance the slide.

**Animation compatibility gate**: the default element animation remains `none`.
When animation is enabled, unknown effects/modes/triggers, invalid numeric or
order values, missing slide/group references, and explicit structural layer,
static-role, or static-placeholder targets fail export; they never downgrade
or disappear silently. An explicit
sidecar group may override only the legacy chrome-name heuristic. `random`
resolution is stable for the same effective input; with `--conversion-trace`,
its resolved rows are written to the trace. Generated export performs per-slide semantic
read-back plus package timing/`p:cTn`/`p:spTgt` validation. Narration merges
audio timing into the existing DOM and preserves animation rows. Direct-PPTX
routes preserve source object animation, compare its object-animation fingerprint
before/after allowed edits, and validate structure; they do not author
animation effects. The exact 22 tuples and OOXML rules live in
[`scripts/docs/pptx-animations.md`](scripts/docs/pptx-animations.md).

**Optional custom animations** (only when the user asks to tune animation order/effects/timing for specific objects):

Run the standalone [`customize-animations`](workflows/customize-animations.md) workflow. Default export applies page transitions but no per-element entrance animation; create `animations.json` (or pass `-a auto`) only when the user asks for element animation or object-level customization.

**Optional recorded narration** (only when the user asks for narrated/video export):

Run the standalone [`generate-audio`](workflows/generate-audio.md) workflow. The AI picks a narration backend (`edge` by default, or a configured cloud provider such as ElevenLabs / MiniMax / Qwen / CosyVoice for high-quality or cloned voices), asks the user once (backend + voice + rate/settings + embed-or-not, all with recommended values), then executes `notes_to_audio.py` and (if chosen) re-exports the PPTX with `--recorded-narration audio`.

Do NOT call `notes_to_audio.py` directly without going through the workflow — `--voice` / `--voice-id` is required and the workflow produces the locale/provider-aware recommendation that makes the choice meaningful.

Full effect list, anchor logic, and limits: [`references/animations.md`](references/animations.md).
The compatibility contract covers PowerPoint OOXML; do not promise identical
animation playback in Keynote or other presentation applications.

> ❌ **NEVER** substitute `cp` for `finalize_svg.py` — finalize performs multiple critical processing steps
> ❌ **NEVER** use `-s final` for a release export. It is a diagnostic comparison only; the supported native route reads `svg_output/`.

> **Post-export annotation window**: the preview service from Step 6 typically remains running after export. If the user submitted annotations in the browser (during Executor or after export) and now asks to apply them — they may quote the browser prompt (`Changes saved to svg_output...` / `修改已保存到 svg_output...`), say "apply my annotations" / "应用注解" / equivalent — run [`live-preview`](workflows/live-preview.md) Step 2 to apply and re-export. Annotations submitted during generation are also handled here, not earlier.

> **Direct edits in the browser**: the user may also stage text / SVG attribute edits in the preview. These land in `svg_output/` only after the user clicks **Apply changes**. If they ask to "re-export" / "重新导出" after applying such edits, just re-run Step 7.2–7.3 (finalize + export); no annotation-application step is needed unless they also saved AI-needed annotations.

> **Preview not running?** Any time the user mentions "live preview", "preview", "看效果", or wants to select/click a slide element and the service is not running, run [`live-preview`](workflows/live-preview.md) Step 1 to start it. If the service is already running, just point them at the URL — do not restart.
